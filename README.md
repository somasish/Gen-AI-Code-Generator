# Current Update
Working on accuracy of the whole system. 

Architecture Diagram - Checkout the file Code-Gen-Diagram.png in the root.

UI Interface - Coming Soon

# Introduction
Generate Business Entity at a code level from given requirement. This repo will contribute in all phases of software life cycle. Code will Generate UML Diagrams, BBD Files, Business entity at a code level.

# Gen AI Code Generator

Requirement to code is a thought that can fast forward software industry and can bring out best results. This software aims at reducing the overall time of the software life cycle.
If we analyse how much time is taken by an idea to get to a requirement stage and a requirement to get into a meaningful business entity and then business logic are put across.
By this project we can significantly decrease the time taken by a requirement to a business entity. We are powering this by ever evolving Generative AI. 
With all these thought a numerous queries in mind like

how can we achieve this? 

Whether we can depend upon Gen AI? 

How the output will be as requirements can be from different domain?

What is the accuracy ? Can Accuracy be increased? 

Which GenAI Model is good for this?

Whether hallucination is a challange?

Whether this solution will work for a new project or for an existing project?

Whether it will follow architechtural patterns and Design patterns?

Whether we have to train our model ?

Lets answer these and then check what all possible solutions we have for so many questions.

This Project is divided into 3 parts and lets discuss one by one.

1) Requirement Refinement

2) Generation of UML Diagram

3) Code and BDD File Generation
